# Ferveo
A synchronous Distributed Key Generation protocol for front-running protection on public blockchains. 

## About

The distributed key generated by Ferveo can be input into a compatible threshold encryption/decryption or a threshold signature protocol. Ferveo distributes the shared private key by relative staking weight and relies on an underlying blockchain for synchonicity. 

## Security Warning
This library is under development and has not been reviewed, audited, or prepared for use.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](book/).
It is recommended to use [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) to render the docs. Run `mdbook serve` in the `book` folder.

A preprint paper describing the construction of Ferveo and the novel cryptosystems used is available at [IACR](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/898).

## Build

A Rust toolchain with version `>= 1.53.0` is required. In the future, Ferveo will target the `stable` toolchain.
Installation via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is recommended.

Run `cargo build --release` to build.
Please note that performance may be significantly poorer when compiling in `Debug` mode.

## Testing

Run `cargo test --release` to run tests. Please note that performance may be significantly poorer when testing in `Debug` mode.

## Benchmarks

Run `cargo bench --benches` to run benchmarks.
