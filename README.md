# Ferveo
A synchronous Distributed Key Generation protocol for front-running protection on public blockchains. 

## About

The distributed key generated by Ferveo can be input into a compatible threshold encryption/decryption or a threshold signature protocol. Ferveo distributes the shared private key by relative staking weight and relies on an underlying blockchain for synchonicity. 

## Security Warning
This library is under development and has not been reviewed, audited, or prepared for use.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](docs/).
It is recommended to use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to render the docs. Run `pandoc docs/ferveo.tex.md` to get a PDF version of the documentation.

## Build

A Rust toolchain with version `>= 1.52.0` is required. In the future, Ferveo will target the `stable` toolchain.
Installation via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is recommended.

Run `cargo build --release` to build.
Please note that performance may be significantly poorer when compiling in `Debug` mode.

## Testing

Run `cargo test --release` to run tests. Please note that performance may be significantly poorer when testing in `Debug` mode.

## Benchmarks
